# **KeyFort League S2**

This league is designed to be more fun vs competitive, the rules & format below are intended to provide a fun and a bit more structured environment to enjoy KeyForge.

## **SCHEDULE**

Leagues nights will be held every other **Tuesday** from **July 16th** to **October 22nd**

_NOTE: You may not qualify for the last two rounds in October but please show up anyways and join in on the shenanigans. These matches cannot be rescheduled and must be played at the FORT_

### **Rescheduling**

Rescheduling is allowed if both players agree, otherwise a victory will be given to the player who shows up on league night.

## **ENTRY FEE**

**\$25**, this covers the cost of any freshies you'll need & prizes

## **MATUPS / RESULTS**

Match results, standings, opponent, and format for the next round will be posted on Thursdays following league night.

_The winner of each match is responsible for reporting the results of a match. This includes the deck guids, winner, and the number of chains._

## **FORMAT**

The league will consist of two separate stages, regular season, and playoffs. We'll mix up the format each week to keep things spicy.

Here's some of the variants you can expect. We'll be playing for points, so it'll be easy to mix up the format.

- Standard Adaptive: Bo3, bring your own deck, swap decks, bid chains for the winning deck
- Reverse Adaptive: Bo3, bring your opponent’s deck, swap decks, bid chains for the winning deck
- Sealed Adaptive: Bo3, open a freshy, swap decks, bid chains for the winning deck **_YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LOOK AT YOUR OPPONENTS DECK LIST_**
- Survival: Bring X decks, order them, play with each deck until it loses, the match ends when one players it out of decks
- Sealed Survival: Same as above but with Freshies
- Triad: Bring 3 decks, your opponent's "benches" 1, play a bo3 with the remaining decks (players switch decks when they win)
- Reversal / Reverse Survival: Bring your opponent's deck(s)

_These are all official formats from Fantasy Flight_
